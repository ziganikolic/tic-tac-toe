// Description of Phaser scene and lifecycle.
// GameScene will extend Phaser.Scene and manage rendering of the mini boards.
// - preload(): load assets for X and O marks.
// - create(): draw grid, register input handlers, and initialize state.
// - update(): run animations and react to state changes.
// This file documents the expected behaviour for the Phaser integration.
